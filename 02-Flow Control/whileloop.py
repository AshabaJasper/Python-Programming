#Want a block to execute over and over, a while statement can do that for you
#the code will execute as long as the condition is True eg
count=0
#condition
while count<5: #don't forget the :
    print("Hey my people")
    count+=1 #increment statement
             #BE CAREFUL: # +=1 is different from =+
    #alternatively
    #count=count+1
