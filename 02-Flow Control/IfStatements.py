#the most common type of flow control is the if statement
#the condition happens and if True, excutes the code in the main body if not, exits of the if function eg
print("Please enter your name(if you are not registered please do):")
name=input()
if name=="Ruth":
    print("Hey Ruth, welcome")
#authenticates Ruth, any other name, the process will exit
